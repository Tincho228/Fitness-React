# Fitness-React
# Overview

Thi Fitness App offers:

1. Workout routines: The User is able to choose one of three workout routines
2. Diet tracking: The User is able to track for 14 days the intake calories and also track the amount of minutes of workout.
3. And health statistics: It offers charts with information about the workout routine as well as calorie trends during 14 days.


I decided to develope this app for several purposes:
1. Learn about react native on mobile apps.
2. Understand the workload and challenges of developing a new mobile app from scratch.

# Development Environment
For this app, I used the following technologies.
1. Visual Studio Code:  lightweight source code editor that runs on Windows and macOS
2. React Native language: React Native is a JavaScript framework for writing real, natively rendering mobile applications for iOS and Android. 
3. Installing React Native Snippets for Visual Studio Code. 
4. Expo Framework: Expo is an open-source platform and framework built around React Native, simplifying the development of cross-platform apps (Android, iOS, and web) by providing a rich set of tools, libraries, and services, including the Expo SDK, Expo Go, and Expo CLI, to streamline the development process.
5. Installing Expo Go on my android cell phone to render the demo. This options saves a lot of computer by using your mobile instead of an emulator. Using Expo Go. Try out app development in a limited sandbox without custom native modules. Great for testing out Expo quickly. Not intended for long-term projects.
6. Libraries and components. Expo provides the app structure, UI basic components and embedded routing for our app. I also included chart libraries from react native to render graphics and statitics. For the database I use Local Storage with an async storage library from React Native.

# Future Work

List of things that need to be fixed, improved, and add in the future.
* UI :The UI can be improved by using Native Tailwind or just using UI components created by Expo or creating new components to make code cleaner and more readable.
* Security: The app can be improved by adding authentication.  
* Service: The app need to have a service such as a Javascript Observer. Instead of using the refresh database button, I could use this tool to observe and apply changes automatically.
